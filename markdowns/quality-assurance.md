Welcome to Spotzer Quality Assurance Team. 

**A. Add PMs, Managers, and team to your Gtalk list.**

First thing to do is, add PMs, Managers, and team to your Gtalk list. So, if you are confusing about something, you can ask via Gtalk or directly to the person. And also, you can find out more contact list in http://hub.softwareseni.co.id/ or via Gtalk which you can add from time to time. Here is the list :

**B. Understand the workflow in SPOTZER Team**

Since we are creating new website for new clients, so all initial request should come from PM first. 

1. PM will assign to BE to setup and content integration.
2. Once Setup done, PM will assign to FE to style the website.
3. Once the styling done, QA will received full test ticket. Check based on initial request from client. You can check from mockup document (Desktop and Breakpoint). Ask PM for the document.
4. If you find bugs, you need to create the issues on Phabicator and assign to BE/FE. Check again these bugs after BE/FE have already fixed.
5. Do full test if all tickets on Phabicator have already done and need full test again. If all function worked fine, report to PM.
6. After all done, PM will show the demo site to clients, and if client wish to have further adjustments, tickets will be sent to developer / designer that QA need to check later one.
7. This cycle will occur until PM stated that the site is ready to launch.


**C. Understand The Bug Tracking System**

1. Register to phabicator : http://projects.softwareseni.com/ 
2. After registering, ask your manager to give access to the project.
3. Learn how to create and manage the ticket.
